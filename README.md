## 📝 Profile
Born in Bologna, I started my studies there before moving to Milan, where I am now completing my master’s degree.
I'm a Computer Engineer driven by curiosity, a love for technology and problem-solving. I enjoy working in teams and tackling innovative challenges. 
At the same time, I am also a musician. I studied Applied Music and Music for Films at the Conservatory of Bologna, and I find incredibly rewarding to create and work with music through the power of computers. 

Arts, cinema, sound and travels deeply inspire me, influencing both my professional and creative journey.
